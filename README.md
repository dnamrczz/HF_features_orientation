# HF_features_orientation
This repository contains the supplementary materials for the paper "Burning, dumping, and site-use during the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic at Hohle Fels Cave, SW Germany". The paper can be found online in Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences.

The supplementary materials include the two-shot orientation data of the artefacts from Hohle Fels and the R codes used to generate the figures and statistical test results. To perform the fabric analysis, we adapted the scripts published by McPherron 2018 (https://github.com/surf3s/Orientations) and Li et al. 2021 (https://github.com/lili0824/sdg_orientation/tree/main).
