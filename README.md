# HF_features_orientation
This repository contains the supplementary materials for the paper "Burning, dumping, and site-use during the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic at Hohle Fels Cave, SW Germany". The paper can be found online in Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences.

The supplementary materials include the two-shot orientation data of the artefacts from Hohle Fels and the R code used to generate the figures and statistical test results.

To perform the fabric analysis, we adapted the script published by McPherron (2018) and Li et al. (2021). The codes can be downloaded from:
